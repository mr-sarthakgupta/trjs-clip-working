- Get the image_embeds using clip_image_embeds.js
- Multiply the matrix from matrix.txt with the image_embeds and get a single value vector
- Add the bias value from bias.txt
- Apply the sigmoid(https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sigmoid_function) function on the obtained value to get the final probability value
